# Keys

The file seems to use a key-value system to store data. The keys are 4 bytes long. Here are some keys I was able to find:

## Reverse-engineered keys

| Key         | Value                           |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |
| A2-C7-C9-09 | Hair dye? def a color for sure. |
| BD-53-07-97 | skin color? def a color.        |
| 93-61-cb-58 | freckle amount                  |
| 55-4a-d2-0f | freckle opacity                 |
| cf-c4-12-64 | sunspot amount                  |
| b9-58-83-b0 | sunspot opacity                 |

It's also possible that A2-C7-* refers to a color data type.
