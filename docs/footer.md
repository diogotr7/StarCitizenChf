# Footer

Perhaps the footer is a save date of some sort. Given the same character data, the footer changes. of course, this makes the crc also change.
Finding the purpose of the footer would be good. As far as I can tell, it is not compressed.
The first byte is always 0xF8, the last two are always 0x00.
